# INFOMQNM Project

### Env
conda (anaconda 3)

### Preparation
The dataset is not directly uploading to GitHub.
Therefore, after clone the git repo:
1. Create a folder named `dataset-zip` in the root directory. 
2. Place the downloaded `k-emophone.zip` inside this folder.
3. Run `dataset_extraction.py` to extract all data to `dataset` folder

The `dataset-zip` and `dataset` folders are added to `.gitignore`.
